always use full patch in command, no relative path
I use cmd windows as terminal so adjust the command accordingly
always use yarn for package manager
use vite
use material-ui for UI components
use javascript instead of typescript
use minimal import for JS library to minimize bundle size
use lazy/dynamic import for component
don't try to run the code, just write the code
